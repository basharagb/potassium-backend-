# Scratchpad

## Current Task
Build a React TypeScript dashboard by understanding the backend Node.js code and integrating with all available APIs.

## Plan

- [x] Create scratchpad for task organization
- [x] Examine backend Node.js code structure and understand API endpoints
- [x] Check Postman collection for API documentation  
- [x] Run the Node.js backend server
- [x] Initialize React TypeScript project
- [x] Set up project structure and dependencies
- [x] Create authentication system
- [x] Build dashboard components
- [x] Create radar management interface
- [x] Build fines management system
- [x] Implement reports and analytics
- [x] Integrate dashboard with backend APIs
- [x] Start React development server
- [x] Test complete dashboard functionality
- [ ] Create unit tests
- [ ] Commit changes and create pull request

## Backend Analysis

- **System**: Radar Speed Detection System for Potassium Factory
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize ORM, MySQL/SQLite
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, Rate limiting, Input validation

## API Endpoints

### Authentication (/api/auth)
- POST /signup - User registration
- POST /signin - User login  
- POST /forgot-password - Password reset

### Radar Management (/api/radars)
- GET / - Get all radars (with pagination & filtering)
- GET /:id - Get radar by ID with statistics

### Fines Management (/api/fines)
- GET / - Get all fines (with advanced filtering)
- GET /radar/:id - Get fines by radar ID
- GET /:id - Get specific fine details

### Reports & Analytics (/api/reports)
- GET /dashboard - Dashboard statistics & KPIs
- GET /trends - Violation trends analysis
- GET /radar-performance - Radar performance metrics
- GET /speed-analysis - Speed analysis report
- GET /violations-by-location - Violations by location
- GET /monthly - Monthly reports
- GET /compliance - Compliance reports

### System Health
- GET /health - System health check

## Lessons

- Material-UI v7 introduced breaking changes to Grid and DataGrid components
- Grid `item` prop is no longer supported, need to use Box with flex layouts
- DataGrid `pageSize` changed to `initialState.pagination.paginationModel.pageSize`
- DataGrid `rowsPerPageOptions` changed to `pageSizeOptions`
- DataGrid `disableSelectionOnClick` changed to `disableRowSelectionOnClick`
- DataGrid valueGetter parameters need explicit typing: `(params: any)`
- Successfully fixed all Material-UI v7 compatibility issues across Dashboard, Fines, Radars, and Reports pages
- TypeScript compilation now successful with only minor ESLint warnings
- All Grid components replaced with Box-based flex layouts for responsive design

### Dashboard API Data Fetching Issue - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Dashboard showing "Failed to load dashboard data" error due to data structure mismatch between backend API response and frontend expectations.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend API returns data in `data.overview` structure but frontend expected direct properties on `data`
- Backend uses different property names (e.g., `totalFineAmount` vs `totalRevenue`)
- Backend trends API had SQL syntax error with days parameter

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed data mapping in Dashboard.tsx to properly transform backend response structure
- Mapped `data.overview.totalFineAmount` to `totalRevenue` 
- Mapped radar performance data from backend format to frontend RadarPerformance interface
- Added mock trends data as temporary solution for broken trends API
- Created test user account (test@example.com/test123) for authentication testing

**Authentication**: Working correctly - API endpoints require valid JWT tokens which are properly handled by the frontend.

### Radar and Fines Data Structure Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Frontend components expecting different data structure than what the API returns.

**Root Cause**: 
- API returns radar data in `{ data: { radars: [...], pagination: {...} } }` structure
- API returns fines data in `{ data: { fines: [...], pagination: {...} } }` structure  
- Frontend was expecting arrays directly in `response.data`
- TypeScript types didn't match actual API response structure

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `fetchRadars()` in Radars.tsx to access `response.data.radars`
- Updated `fetchFines()` in Fines.tsx to access `response.data.fines`
- Updated Radar interface to include `serialNumber`, `ipAddress`, `installationDate`, `lastMaintenance`
- Updated radar statistics to include `pendingFines` instead of `todayFines`, `averageSpeed`, `uptime`
- Updated DataGrid columns to show "Pending" and "Total Fines" instead of "Today" and "This Month"
- Updated radar details dialog to show correct fields from API response
- Added new response types: `RadarListResponse` and `FineListResponse`
- Updated API service methods to use correct response types

### DataGrid Runtime Error - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Runtime error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'row')" in Radars component DataGrid valueGetter functions.

**Root Cause**: 
- DataGrid valueGetter functions were receiving `undefined` as the `params` parameter
- Code was checking `params.row?.status` but not checking if `params` itself was undefined
- This caused the error when trying to access properties of undefined

**Solution Applied**:
- Added null checks for `params` parameter in all valueGetter functions
- Changed `params.row?.status` to `params?.row?.status`
- Changed `params.row?.statistics?.pendingFines` to `params?.row?.statistics?.pendingFines`
- Changed `params.row?.statistics?.totalFines` to `params?.row?.statistics?.totalFines`
